# To do

* When a am.Observable.value is get add a dep to the observer (this), so when the observable changes the observer will be rerendered.
* Create StoreRoot class with property user (property should have saveToLocalStorage = true).
* Add StoreRoot class to store with sync to localstorage
* Get StoreRoot  from store (lazy loading user, only when it is rendered)
* convert dom to virtual dom
* set user as dep for div
* render div with current username



* remove services and helpers folders (create feature folders when needed)

## System
* fix loader so it can use loads scripts based on the location of the script.
* move data in system to am.store.data.ts
* load am.store.data before any other thing inside system and use it.
