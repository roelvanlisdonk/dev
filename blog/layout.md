Notes on margin and padding

1. vertical margin auto-collapses, whereas vertical padding does not.
2. 
- padding can be used to add more space around the anchor text of a text link in order to be better clickable on handheld devices; this cannot be done with margin since it adds space outside of the box where the contents (the anchor text)
- padding is included in the click region and background color/image, but not the margin

Some people say:
By default I use margin everywhere, except when I have a border or background and want to increase the space inside that visible box.
